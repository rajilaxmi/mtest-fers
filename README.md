Project : Festival Event Registration System

This project is divided into Administration and User. The Admin deals with addition of new event, updating, deleting events, number of participant for each event, etc. The user deals with registering for events, specifying number of members in each team participating in events, etc. 
Here, I've uploaded files related to Admin pages. I've attached the use cases for creating new admin(UCA04), adding new event(UCA05), adding event session(UCA06) and updating event(UCA07), along with Business Rules, Data Dictionary.
I've performed 3 passes for Release 1 of FERS where I've attached test scripts (FERS.APT.T5.TSc.(004-007)), test scenarios (FERS.APT.TS.T5.UCA_(04-07)) and defect log respective to each Passes.
